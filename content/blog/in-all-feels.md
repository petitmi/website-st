In all the feels  
it's hitting my softest gut  
I sit there and thought life is an agony  
when I heard the far cry from the great stones

I keep the past sensations reflected  
The past solitude cannot keep me chill but nourished  
Standing in the chaos that your statue faded in  
Suspecting the truth is telling the lie to me
