        <td  style="width:45%">

把云朵揽入口袋里，捏碎了变成许多星辰<br />
华丽又锋利，就像你曾经说过的话一样<br />
可这些话越仔细想越想不起来，就像这两年的变化一样<br />
好像不小，也越仔细想越想不起来

人们说的量变达到质变，可是短短数十年，何以要变，又变了什么？

想象，<br />
自己是一个符号，在全力冲刺，追着变化跑

再想象，<br />
在纷扰里光着脚漫步，不用看脚下的每一步路，用皮肤触碰各种表皮

再想象，<br />
忙碌地同情每一个人，忙碌于呵护和赞美自己

同情一个在别人的期望和自己的期望里，酒后驾驶的人

Take the clouds and tuck them into my pocket, crush them into numerous stars.<br />
Splendid and sharp, just like the words you once said.<br />
But the more you ponder these words, the harder they become to recall, much like the changes of these past two years.<br />
It feels significant, yet the more you ponder, the harder it is to remember.

People say that a quantitative change leads to a qualitative change, but in just a few decades, why must it change, and what has changed?

Imagine,<br />
Being a symbol, sprinting with all your might, chasing after change.

Imagine once more,<br />
Strolling barefoot in the midst of chaos, not needing to scrutinize each step, touching all sorts of surfaces with your skin.

Imagine once more,<br />
Busy sympathizing with every person, busy nurturing and praising oneself.

Sympathizing with someone who, within the expectations of others and their own, drove while intoxicated.
